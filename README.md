4) Edit the Kobolds data by changing the numbers to however you see fit (some are limited to a minimum or maximum for stability)

5) When done, you can rename the save or Export the save and rename it there, the game will only read saves that are in the location mentioned above

6) Profit!, open up the save in game, if you renamed the save it wont have an image on the "Save/Load" screen because the save name doesnt have a matching image with the same name
   (Example of no image)
